      Heaps are a data structure found in comptuer science which allows easy organization of elements in ascending/descending order.
      Max heaps follow the principle of having the parent greater than both children at every level.
      For this Programming Practice, check if the given array is a max heap by using recursion.
      Example: CheckMaxHeap(potentialHeap);   //Returns true if the array is a heap.
